**Student Survey Application**

I have developed an application leveraging Angular, Node.js, Spring Boot, and MySQL to 
implement comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. 
The homepage features three primary navigation links: Home, Student Survey Form, and List All Surveys. 
• By selecting the Student Survey link, users are redirected to a dedicated survey page 
where they can complete and submit the survey form. 
• The List All Surveys link leads to a page displaying all submitted surveys. This page 
includes Update and Delete buttons for each record, allowing users to modify or remove 
specific entries as needed. 
This streamlined interface ensures a user-friendly experience for managing survey data 
efficiently. 
Technologies: 
• Angular 
• Node.js 
• Spring Boot 
Prerequisites: 
• JDK (version 17 or higher) 
• Angular CLI (version 15 or higher) 
• Node.js (version 18 or higher) 
• Spring Boot (3.0 or above) 
IDE: 
• Eclipse Ide (With STS installed) 
• Visual Studio Code 
• MySql server/ work bench  
Application Code Setup: 
1. Download and install Node.js from their official website. 
2. Verify their installation of node in the command line by using the commands npm -v and 
node -v 
3. Install Angular CLI globally by using the command: npm install -g @angular/cli and 
verify its installation by ng version 
4. Install JDK from the Oracle website. Verify the installation using the command: java 
version. 
5. Install Spring Boot and verify its installation using spring - -version. 
6. Install the necessary IDEs, Eclipse IDE and Visual Studio Code. 
7. In the CLI, create a new angular project using “ng new project-name” and navigate to 
that folder using cd project-name. Generate the required components like 
homeComponent, surveryFormComponent, survey-listComponent using “ng generate 
component component-name”. 
8. Open the angular project created in the Visual Studio Code and start developing the front
end code as needed. 
9. Create a Spring Boot Project using the Spring Initializr and select Spring Web, Spring 
Data JPA and MySQL JDBC Driver dependencies. Download the generated project as a 
ZIP file and extract the project to a desired location. 
10. Import the extracted project into Eclipse IDE as a maven project and click finish. 
11. Start the Spring Boot Application by right-clicking on the project in Eclipse and Run As 
> Spring Boot App. 
12. Once started, the application can be accessed at URL: http://localhost:8080. 
13. Start the Angular Application by running “ng serve” in the Angular project directory. 
14. Now, the angular application can be accessed at the URL: http://localhost:4200. 
15. The full application can be viewed by opening a web browser and using the URLs to 
view and interact with the application. This structured workflow ensures the seamless 
integration of the Angular frontend and Spring Boot backend applications.
